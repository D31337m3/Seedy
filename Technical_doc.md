# Seedy - Technical Documentation

## Overview
Seedy is an Ethereum seed phrase management and recovery tool built with security and transparency in mind. This document explains how each component works and the security measures in place.

## Core Components

### 1. Dependencies
- `mnemonic`: Implements BIP39 standard for seed phrase generation/validation
- `eth_account`: Official Ethereum account management library
- `itertools`: Python standard library for combinatorial operations
- `datetime` & `time`: For progress tracking
- `os`: Cross-platform system operations

2. Key Classes
 ProgressTracker

class ProgressTracker:
    def __init__(self, mode_name):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        self.last_update = time.time()
        self.processed = 0
        self.mode_name = mode_name

•	Provides real-time feedback during long operations
•	Updates every 2 seconds to prevent screen flooding
•	Shows processing speed and progress bar

3. Core Functions Explained
Seed Validation

def validate_seed(words):
•	Verifies seed phrase length (12, 15, 18, or 24 words)
•	Checks against BIP39 wordlist
•	Confirms checksum validity
•	Generates corresponding ETH address as proof
•	Returns boolean validation result

Address Generation

def validate_eth_address(seed_phrase: str, target_address: str) -> bool:

•	Uses official eth_account library
•	Implements HD wallet derivation path
•	Generates addresses deterministically
•	Performs case-insensitive comparison

Position Scanner

def scan_positions_for_address(seed_words, target_address, wordlist):

•	Systematically tests each word position
•	Maintains BIP39 checksum validity
•	Generates and validates addresses
•	Records successful matches
•	Saves results to file

Pattern Search

def search_address_pattern(partial_words, target_pattern, wordlist):

•	Implements combinatorial search
•	Validates checksum for each combination
•	Matches address endings
•	Thread-safe implementation

4. Security Measures
Data Handling
•	No network connectivity required
•	All operations performed locally
•	Results saved to local files
•	No seed storage in memory after operation

Validation
•	BIP39 standard compliance
•	Checksum verification
•	Standard HD wallet derivation
•	Official Ethereum libraries

User Protection
•	Clear progress indicators
•	Interrupt capability (Ctrl+C)
•	Input validation
•	Error handling

###5. File Operations

Output Files
•	position_matches.txt: Position scan results
•	pattern_matches.txt: Pattern search results
•	missing_words.txt: Recovery results
•	descrambled.txt: Valid permutations
•	new_seed.txt: Generated seed phrases

6. Usage Recommendations

Secure Environment
•	Use on air-gapped machine
•	Clear system memory after use
•	Verify addresses before transactions
•	Keep output files secure

Input Validation
•	Check word count matches supported lengths
•	Verify words against BIP39 wordlist
•	Validate ETH addresses format
•	Test with known seeds first

7. Technical Details

Supported Features
•	BIP39 mnemonic implementation
•	ETH address generation
•	Multiple word lengths (12/15/18/24)
•	Cross-platform compatibility
Performance
•	Progress tracking
•	Speed monitoring
•	Resource management
•	Interrupt handling
8. Error Handling
Input Validation

Best Practices
1.	Always verify generated addresses
2.	Keep secure backups of results
3.	Use offline systems when possible
4.	Test with known seeds first
5.	Verify all inputs before processing
